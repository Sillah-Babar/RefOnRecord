# Installation & Setup

## Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Step 2: Initialize Database

Run the setup script to create all database tables:

```bash
python setup_database.py
```

This script will:
- Connect to the database (creates SQLite file if it doesn't exist)
- Drop existing tables (if any)
- Create all tables
- Set up all relationships, constraints, and indexes

## Step 3: Populate with Sample Data

Run the population script to add comprehensive test data:

```bash
python populate_database.py
```

This script creates:
- 3 users (1 premium tier, 2 normal tier)
- 4 resume projects
- 8 work experiences with various verification statuses
- 8 verification requests (4 verified, 3 pending, 1 rejected)
- 5 share links with different access types
- 4 active sessions
